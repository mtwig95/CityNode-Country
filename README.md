The project was written as part of the course "20441 - Introduction to Computer Science Using Java" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University).
This project is a follow-up project to the city from repositories Point & City and country & matrix

#CityNode
The department represents one city in the country, the program represents a country by using a linked list that maintains the list of cities in the country.
#Country
The department represents a country, the program represents a country by using a linked list that maintains the list of cities in the country. And all the features are realized (as in the country) only this time by a linked list.
